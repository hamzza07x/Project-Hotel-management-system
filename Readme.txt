Assalam o Alaikum!

I am Muhammad Hamza currently studying at fast Nuces Pakistan.

This is my first project for the course programming fundamentals.

The code starts with including necessary header files like `<stdio.h>`, `<time.h>`, `<stdlib.h>`, `<unistd.h>`, and `<string.h>`.

Function prototypes are declared at the beginning to inform the compiler about the functions that will be defined later.

The `main()` function acts as the entry point of the program. It displays a welcome message and presents the user with options: logging in, registering as a new user, or exiting.

The `registered()` function allows registered users to log in by entering their email and password, verifying them against the information stored in `customerInfo.txt`.

The `new()` function facilitates the registration process for new users by prompting them for name and email. If the email is valid and not already registered, a password is generated and stored.

The `menu()` function displays options available to the logged-in user like checking room availability, making reservations, managing bookings, or logging out.

`availability()` displays available rooms, their types, occupancy, availability, and price per night. Users can make reservations, manage bookings, or return to the main menu.

`reservation()` allows users to reserve rooms by specifying type, number of rooms, people, and nights. It calculates the total bill and updates room availability.

`manage()` lets users view their bookings, nights stayed, and total price. They can choose to make another reservation or return to the main menu.

Several utility functions perform tasks like checking email validity, generating random passwords, updating user information, and retrieving user data from files.

In summary, the code implements a hotel booking system with registration, login, room availability check, reservation, and booking management using file handling.

And That's all.
Thanks 
Have a nice day!
